## Reference images

All images used in this project were acquired under the [*CC0 1.0 Universal*][URL-CC0] public domain dedication.

> *This selection of reference images is based solely on the ability to study the diverse topology of the human body.*
*Complex details surrounding each image have not been interrogated, and as such the use of an image does not reflect an endorsement of the photographer nor of the subject.*

> ***In the event a photograph of you / taken by you is referenced in this project and you would like to request its removal, or if you otherwise object to the use of an image, please [open a public issue][URL-New-Issue] or email me privately via <recursivenomad@protonmail.com> to request removal of the image from this project.***
