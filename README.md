**A diverse CC0 reference image set of the human form**
=======================================================

### Annotated as a topological reference for the [biomechanical-basemesh][URL-basemesh] project

&nbsp;



***Purpose and scope***
=======================

The purpose of this reference image set is to inform the development of a topologically-universal human 3D model in the [biomechanical-basemesh][URL-basemesh] project, emphasizing accurate deformations and edge flow.
Due to its size, this repository is hosted separately from the downstream project and included as a submodule within it.
