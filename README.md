**A diverse CC0 reference image set of the human form**
=======================================================

### Annotated as a topological reference for the [biomechanical-basemesh][URL-basemesh] project

&nbsp;



***Purpose and scope***
=======================

The purpose of this reference image set is to inform the development of a topologically-universal human 3D model in the [biomechanical-basemesh][URL-basemesh] project, emphasizing accurate deformations and edge flow.
Due to its size, this repository is hosted separately from the downstream project and included as a submodule within it.

&nbsp;



***A note about reference image diversity***
============================================

A concerted effort was made to represent distributed human diversity amongst these reference images in order to best inform a universal human topology.
Unfortunately, the images freely available in the public domain (or equivalent) disproportionaly represent certain human populations over others.
There was also understandably a bias towards selecting images which would be informative to human topology, such as visibility of pores/creases/wrinkles, strong or unique muscle activation, an unobstructed view of the skin, etc.
As a result, despite all efforts to inform a universally inclusive basemesh, this image set may represent a skewed human demographic.

If you identify a lapse in universal topology in the [downstream project][URL-basemesh], please [open a public issue there][URL-New-Issue] or email me privately via <recursivenomad@protonmail.com> to discuss incorporating the underrepresented features into this project (and by extension, into the biomechanical-basemesh topology).

=====================

- The effort to represent distributed diversity of human ethnicities throughout the reference images was informed in part by the major ethno-linguistic assemblages/clades described in this open-access paper:

- The range of expressions distributed throughout the facial reference images was informed in part by the facial expressions discussed in this open-access paper:
